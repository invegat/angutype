Minimal changes to https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter
so that I can more easily keep up with new releases.
Using Stylus/Rupture and Pug instead of CSS and HTML.  
   http://stylus-lang.com/
   https://github.com/jescalan/rupture
   https://github.com/pugjs/pug/

So far I have done 01-06 of chapter 7, click the "Projects" tab
(the other tabs are from the webpack starter)
